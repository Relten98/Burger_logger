# THE BURGER LOGGER
(Built in 2021, by Relten)

## BUILT WITH
Node.js
Handlebars
mySQL
Heroku

### HOW TO USE
Simply boot up the linked website to log a few burgers, and change a few paraeters involving them.

This application can store various burgers in the list of burgers, however it is by no means of any sort of imagination, exceptionally elegant. That is entirely a blunder that I will admit on my part.

### INSTALLATION
No installation required, simply boot up the deployed website (https://relten-burger-logger.herokuapp.com/)
